## Lightning Talks at Turing 

---

### Overview
* Everyone in Module 2 is required to give a lightning talk. The lightning talk will be about a technical topic.
* The lightning talk will be (max) 5 minutes long.
* We will presenting these talks to ourselves (module 2 only).
* See the list of (potential) topics below.
* If you'd like to give a talk on another topic (possibly something particularly interesting to module 2 specifically), feel free to let me know! You **must** have your topic approved.
* Topics are first come first serve.
* We're giving these talks week 2, 3, and 4 - about 2 talks a day.

### Picking a Topic

* You don't need to be an expert on a topic. You can do the research and become expert enough to deliver a valuable talk.
* A talk needs to teach something of value to the audience.
* A talk needs to be at an appropriate level for the audience, not too basic and not too advanced.
* A talk needs to have a *message*, not just a subject. "Introduction to RSpec" is boring, "Why You Should Use RSpec" has a message.

#### Examples of Previous Topics: 

* Using Computer Science to manipulate OKCupid
* When Pairing Goes Wrong
* How to Survive the Titanic with Machine Learning
* The TDD Holy War
* Is Elegant Ruby Fast?
* Genetic Algorithms with Ruby Processing
* Ancient Cryptography

4. At some point before the day of your lightning talk, you'll need to touch base with Casey to run through your talk. **You** are responsible for reaching out to schedule this. It is not required to physically meet (unless you'd like) - it's also okay to send an outline of your talk via Slack to get it approved. If you don't run through your talk prior to the day of, you will have to reschedule your talk.
