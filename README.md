Topic: abc
--- 


### Overview
* Everyone in Module 2 is required to give a lightning talk. The lightning talk will be about a technical topic.
* The lightning talk will be (max) 5 minutes long.
* We will presenting these talks to ourselves (module 2 only).
* See the list of (potential) topics below.
* If you'd like to give a talk on another topic (possibly something particularly interesting to module 2 specifically), feel free to let me know! You **must** have your topic approved.
* Topics are first come first serve.
* We're giving these talks week 2, 3, and 4 - about 2 talks a day.

### Picking a Topic

* You don't need to be an expert on a topic. You can do the research and become expert enough to deliver a valuable talk.
* A talk needs to teach something of value to the audience.
* A talk needs to be at an appropriate level for the audience, not too basic and not too advanced.
* A talk needs to have a *message*, not just a subject. "Introduction to RSpec" is boring, "Why You Should Use RSpec" has a message.

#### Examples of Previous Topics: 

* Using Computer Science to manipulate OKCupid
* When Pairing Goes Wrong
* How to Survive the Titanic with Machine Learning
* The TDD Holy War
* Is Elegant Ruby Fast?
* Genetic Algorithms with Ruby Processing
* Ancient Cryptography
